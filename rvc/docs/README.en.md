> Realtime Voice Conversion Software using RVC : [w-okada/voice-changer](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer)

> The dataset for the pre-training model uses nearly 50 hours of high quality VCTK open source dataset.

> High quality licensed song datasets will be added to training-set one after another for your use, without worrying about copyright infringement.
## Summary
This repository has the following features:
+ Reduce tone leakage by replacing source feature to training-set feature using top1 retrieval;
+ Easy and fast training, even on relatively poor graphics cards;
+ Training with a small amount of data also obtains relatively good results (>=10min low noise speech recommended);
+ Supporting model fusion to change timbres (using ckpt processing tab->ckpt merge);
+ Easy-to-use Webui interface;
+ Use the UVR5 model to quickly separate vocals and instruments.
## Preparing the environment
We recommend you install the dependencies through poetry.

The following commands need to be executed in the environment of Python version 3.8 or higher:
```bash
# Install PyTorch-related core dependencies, skip if installed
# Reference: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

#For Windows + Nvidia Ampere Architecture(RTX30xx), you need to specify the cuda version corresponding to pytorch according to the experience of https://github.com/liujing04/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/issues/21
#pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

# Install the Poetry dependency management tool, skip if installed
# Reference: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install the project dependencies
poetry install
```
You can also use pip to install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparation of other Pre-models
RVC requires other pre-models to infer and train.

You need to download them from our [Huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/tree/main/).

Here's a list of Pre-models and other files that RVC needs:
```bash
hubert_base.pt

./pretrained 

./uvr5_weights

If you want to test the v2 version model (the v2 version model has changed the input from the 256 dimensional feature of 9-layer Hubert+final_proj to the 768 dimensional feature of 12-layer Hubert, and has added 3 period discriminators), you will need to download additional features

./pretrained_v2

#If you are using Windows, you may also need this dictionary, skip if FFmpeg is installed
ffmpeg.exe
```
Then use this command to start Webui:
```bash
python infer-web.py
```
If you are using Windows, you can download and extract `RVC-beta.7z` to use RVC directly and use `go-web.bat` to start Webui.

There's also a tutorial on RVC in Chinese and you can check it out if needed.
